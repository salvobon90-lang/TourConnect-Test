🎯 Objectives

1️⃣ Complete Redesign of the Tour Creation Flow

Replace the old manual latitude/longitude fields with an interactive map picker (Leaflet or Google Maps).

The guide can drop a pin for the meeting point or draw a zone polygon.

Automatically save coordinates, radius, and city name.

Show preview inside the “Community Map” once published.

Replace free-text language entry with a multi-select dropdown containing standard options:
🇮🇹 Italian, 🇬🇧 English, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇪🇸 Spanish, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇷🇺 Russian.
(Support for more via database if needed.)

2️⃣ Dynamic & Community-Oriented Pricing System
We’re introducing a smarter price management model designed for both private and community bookings.

🔸 Base Price Settings (Guide Side):

Base price per person.

Minimum and maximum participants.

Group discount thresholds (e.g., 10% off from 4+ people, 25% off from 8+).

“Community Mode” toggle → enables cost sharing.

🔸 Community Mode (New Feature):

If activated, the tour becomes joinable by multiple tourists directly from the “Community Map.”

The price per user drops dynamically as more users join the same tour.

Real-time counter of joined participants + visual progress bar (like crowdfunding).

When the minimum participant goal is reached → tour becomes “Confirmed.”

Tour visibility badge:

🟠 “Active Community Tour” if open for new participants.

🟢 “Confirmed Departure” once the minimum size is met.

🔴 “Closed” once the date/time is full or expired.

🔸 Optional Add-ons:

Guides can add “extras” (meals, transport, souvenirs, etc.) with independent pricing.

Add-ons can be toggled by users during booking.

🔸 Automatic Reward System Integration:

Guide earns +75 points for every confirmed community tour.

Tourists earn +30 points for joining one.

Dynamic price updates and reward triggers must be handled via WebSocket real-time updates.

3️⃣ Tour Creation Wizard (Frontend UI)
Convert the single static form into a multi-step wizard:

Basic Info: Title, short description, category, duration, language(s).

Details: Full description (rich text), included/excluded items, difficulty, cancellation policy.

Media: Upload images/videos.

Location: Map picker, meeting point, area radius.

Pricing:

Base price, group discounts, community mode toggle.

Add-ons management.

Availability: Calendar picker for available dates & times.

Review & Publish: Preview before submission + “Save as Draft” or “Publish.”

4️⃣ Community Map Integration

Once a tour is published, if “Community Mode” is ON → automatically display it on the Community Map page.

Each tour pin shows:

Title

Starting time/date

Current participant count

Price evolution

Distance from user (based on geolocation).

Clicking the pin opens a quick preview with a “Join Tour” button.

5️⃣ Backend Upgrades

Update database schema:

Add community_mode, min_participants, max_participants, discount_rules, current_participants, status, addons (JSON).

Add API routes:

POST /api/tours → create tour

PATCH /api/tours/:id → update tour

GET /api/community-tours → fetch tours with active community mode

WS /community-tours → real-time updates for participants count and pricing

Add validation for ownership and admin moderation (pending, approved, rejected).

6️⃣ Admin Dashboard

New moderation tab /admin/tours:

Approve, edit, or remove tours.

See map view of all active tours.

Filter by: verified guides, community mode, pending approval.

7️⃣ Translations & Localization

Translate all new fields, labels, and notifications (EN, IT, FR, DE, ES).

Auto-detect default language from guide’s profile.

8️⃣ Testing & QA Checklist

✅ Verify tour creation works end-to-end.

✅ Check map picker saves correct location.

✅ Ensure price adjusts dynamically when new users join.

✅ Ensure reward points are triggered correctly.
